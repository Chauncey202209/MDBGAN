# Image Quilting
This code implements the Image Quilting algorithm for texture synthesis. It is written in MATLAB and requires MATLAB to run.

1.Installation
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the downloaded repository folder.
Input Images
The input images should be placed in the MDBGAN\comparative methods\data folder. Make sure to have the necessary images in this folder before running the code.

2.Documentation
The Instruction file for 2D Image Quilting can be found in the MDBGAN\comparative methods\ImageQuiltingmaster\2D_CIQ_TS_v3 folder. 
The Instruction file for 3D Image Quilting can be found in the MDBGAN\comparative methods\ImageQuiltingmaster\3D_IQ folder.
Make sure to refer to this documentation for a detailed explanation of the code and its parameters.

3.Usage
There are two main programs in this code:

CIQ_TS_v3.m is the main program file for the 2D Image Quilting algorithm.
CIQ_3D_v4.m is the main program file for the 3D Image Quilting algorithm.
Before running the code, make sure to adjust the experimental parameters in the main program file according to your requirements.

4.Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

Open MATLAB and navigate to the downloaded repository folder.
Open the desired main program file (CIQ_TS_v3.m or CIQ_3D_v4.m) in MATLAB.
Adjust the experimental parameters in the main program file.
Run the main program file to execute the Image Quilting algorithm.
Please note that running the code may take some time, depending on the size and complexity of the input images.
